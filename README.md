# Guess the Number Game in Go Lang

ðŸ”¢ A fun command-line game where computer try to guess your number!

## Description

This is a simple command-line game where the computer tries to guess a number that you are thinking of. The program uses a binary search algorithm to make smart guesses and narrow down the possible range of numbers. After each guess, the program will ask you if the guess was too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the computer correctly guesses your number.

3. Run the command `./guessing_game` to start the game.
4. Think of a number between 1 and 100.
5. Follow the instructions in the command-line interface to provide feedback on the computer's guesses.
6. The game ends when the computer correctly guesses your number.
